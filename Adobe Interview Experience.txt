Online Rounds
*******************

Round 1:
------------
-> 15 Aptitude and Logical Reasoning Questions.
-> 5 Conceptual Coding Questions on C, C++ language. Predict output or find the error types questions. All were MCQs.

Round 2:
-------------
-> You are provided with list of names and number of votes corresponding to each name. Output the name with maximum
number of votes. If there are multiple solutions, print the lexicographically smallest name.

-> Consider a string, s = “abc”. An alphabetically-ordered sequence of substrings of s would be 
{“a”, “ab”, “abc”, “b”, “bc”, “c”}. If we reduce this sequence to only those substrings that start with
a vowel and end with a consonant, we’re left with {“ab”, “abc”}. The alphabetically first element in this
reduced list is “ab”, and the alphabetically last element is “abc”. 
For a given string, determine the alphabetically lowest and alphabetically highest substring that start with a 
vowel and end with a consonant.


Onsite Rounds

Round 3:
-------------
-> Brief Introduction

-> A debugging question was asked on the concepts of Constructor and Destructor in C++.

-> Write a program to find the count of set bits in a given number.
Expected Time Complexity: O(Count of set bits)

->Given two linked lists. Write a program to detect if they intersect. If yes, find the intersecting node.
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
Expected Time Complexity: O(Max(len1,len2))

Round 4:
----------------
-> Brief Introduction.

-> Asked about Projects.

-> Check if a Linked List is a Palindrome or not.
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
Expected Time Complexity: O(len)

-> Predict the output questions based on pointer concepts in C++.
