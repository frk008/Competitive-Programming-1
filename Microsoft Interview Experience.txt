Online Round: (Telephonic HR Conversation)
**********************************************

Round 1: (15 mins)
------------------
-> Are you willing to relocate to Hyderabad ?

-> Why would you like to leave current company so early ?

-> Your Current Notice Period ?


Onsite Rounds:
*************************

Round 2: (1 hr)
----------------
-> Brief Introduction about the role in Current Company.

-> Given an array of size 2*n, where first n elements will be a1, a2, a3,.....an and remaining n elements 
will be b1, b2, b3,......bn. Write a program to output the array in the form:
a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3,.........an, bn. Assume the size of the array to be power of 2.

*Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
Expected Time Complexity: O(n) or O(nlogn)

-> Design a Max Stack, where you have to implement push, pop and getMax functions. getMax will output the maximum
element from the stack.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1) for all operations
Expected Space Complexity: O(size of stack) or O(1)


Round 3: (1 hr)
------------------
-> Brief Introduction and discuss about the achievments and responsiblities in the earlier organizations you have worked.

-> Why would you like to leave your current company so early ?

-> You are provided with a list of words and queries. In each query, you will be given a word. Design an algorithm to 
output all the words from the given list which are anagrams to the queried word.
First the interviewer asked to design the data structure which you will use to solve this problem.

-> Design a Min Stack, where you have to implement push, pop and getMin functions. getMin will output the minimum
element from the stack.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1) for all operations
Expected Space Complexity: O(size of stack) or O(1)

-> Given a boolean row-wise sorted matrix of size N*M. Write a program to find the row number which has maximum number of 1's. 
Expected Time Complexity: Linear

-> You are provided a matrix of size N*N. An element in the matrix occurs more than (N^2)/2 times. All other elements of the matrix 
are distinct and occur only once. Design an algorithm to find that element which has frequency > (N^2)/2 in the best optimal way.
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
Expected Time Complexity: Less than O((N^2)/2)

-> Above question is now reduced to 1-D array of size N, where an element was occuring more than N/2 times and all other elements
are distinct and occur only once. Find that element.
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
Expected Time Complexity: Less than O(N/2)


Round 4: (1 hr)
------------------
-> Brief Introduction and discussion about the roles and responsiblities in current company.

-> Explain the internal structure of Database, and how data is stored.

-> What is Copy Constructor in C++ ?

-> Explain what are microservices and how they work.

-> What are REST APIs and how they function ?

-> Why Microsoft ?

-> What is Singleton Design pattern ? Explain it by writing code for the Singleton class.

-> Given a Binary Tree. Design an algorithm to print the circumference nodes of the tree in clock-wise direction.


Round 5: (1 hr)
-------------------
-> Brief Introduction.

-> Write a program to reverse a given integer to output another integer. Need to handle cases for negative integer and those integers 
which will overflow when reversed.

-> Design Question:
You are provided a hierarchy of an IT organization in a tree structure. Suppose at top is CEO, then under him CXO's, then under CXO's 
there are Directors, then under Directors there are Managers, and so on till junior developers.
Each role in the hierarchy has complete information of Payments of hierarchy under him (including himself).

Design a Payment system for the given IT organization. After designing, implement an API or a function, which when 
provided a particular role as an input, will output the entire cost incurred by the hierarchy under that role.

-> Discussions were made on why class or abstract class instead of Interface.

-> How interface will help in designing ?

-> Computer Science Fundamentals:
What is Deadlock ? Explain with example.

What is Process ?

Explain Singleton Design pattern and where it can be used ? Write a code to explain it. 


Round 6: (1 hr) (Hiring Manager Round)
-----------------------------------------
-> Given a Binary Tree. Design an algorithm to print the circumference nodes of the tree in clock-wise direction.
Extra Constraints were added: No extra space should be used. Try to solve it recursively.

Follow up: Solve the same problem for N-ary tree.

-> Given a Binary Tree. Design an algorithm to delete the circumference nodes of the tree.
Again no extra space is allowed. Solve it recursively.

Follow up: Solve the same problem for N-ary tree. 

-> Write the modular recursive codes for the following functions:
#Print the left boundary nodes of tree.
#Print the right boundary nodes of tree.
#Print the bottom boundary nodes of tree. 

Now combine all three functions to print the complete boundary nodes of tree. Again, no extra space was allowed. 

-> Discussions about the current roles and responsiblities and also about the previous employer.

-> What is your biggest achievment in your professional life ?

-> Why you want to switch so early from your current Company ?

-> Which role you like more : Back-end or Front-end ? Why not the other one ?
