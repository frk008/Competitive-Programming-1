-> A sorted row wise Boolean matrix is given. Find the row number which has maximum number of 1's.
Expected Complexity: O(n)

-> A connected undirected graph, a source and a destination are provided. Devise an Algorithm
 to find the longest path between the source and the destination.
 Expected Complexity: O(n^2)

 whose sum is 0.
 Expected Complexity: O(n)

 
 ROUND 3 (Technical Round): (1 hour)
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 -> Introduce Yourself.

 ->Find the largest rectangular area inside the histogram.
 (Before the interviewer completed the question, I told the entire approach. Unfortunately,
 this question was removed).

 ->A Binary Search Tree is provided. Every node has a value assigned. Write an algorithm to print all the triplets(3 distinct nodes in BST)
 whose sum is equal to K.
 Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2)
 Expected Space Complexity: O(logn)  [Space Optimization was the main focus]

 ->An array of numbers(positive, negative, zero) is provided. Print the maximum of every K size
 contiguous sub-arrays.
 Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

 
 ROUND 4 (Technical Round): (1 hour)
--------------------------------------------------------------
-> Introduce Yourself.

->A row wise and column wise sorted matrix is provided. Write an algorithm to print the entire
matrix in sorted form (ascending or descending).
Expected Time Complexity: Less than O(n^2(logn^2))

->An array of strings is provided. Find the count of string pairs which when concatenated 
becomes palindrome.
Expected Time Complexity: Less than O(n^2*(len))

-> Write a SQL Query to find the Nth highest value from a table.

->What you know about Locking Mechanisms ? Explain Semaphores and Critical Section.


ROUND 5 (Technical Round): (1 hour 15 minutes)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-> Introduce Yourself. 

-> Design Chess. (OOPS Knowledge Test)
Class Diagram was basically asked. Need to tell all the classes that can be required along with
attributes and functions.
Main focus of Interviewer was on Knight Class. She asked lots of questions on what functions can be added
and what more attributes can be added. How to distinguish between Knights of opposite team ? 
Requirement of Interface or not ?

-> Difference between Abstract Class and Interface. Expalin with examples.
When Abstract class is needed ? And When Interface is not needed ?

->A Max Heap is provided. Find the minimum element in Max Heap.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

->A Binary Tree is given. An infinite amount of water is poured on root. Every node has value assigned to it.
When a node absorbs water, then water is sinked towards its children. Time taken by node to absorb water is 
equal to value assigned to it.
Find the maximum time by which entire Tree will absorb water.

-> What do you know about Process Synchronization ?
Explain Semaphores and Difference between Binary and Counting Semaphores with code.
What is Mutex and how it helps in Critical Section ?

->What do you know about Database Indexing ? What are its Pros and Cons ?

->Do you know about Design Patterns ? What is Singleton Desing pattern ?
Explain Singleton pattern with lock avoiding mechanisms.


ROUND 6 (Director/Manager Round): (1 hour)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
-> What do you know about OYO IOT team ? What products are you aware of ?

-> How resourceful you are in your company ? Out of total revenue of company, how many dollars are
generated because of you ? Explain your importance and role.

-> You are doing a 14 days sprint work. But suddenly business requirements arrive and you have to complete it 
within 5 days. How will you do that ?

-> Why OYO and Why you want to change your current company ? Give atleast two points in support.

-> Suppose you have to launch Uber Pool. You have two candidate cities. In one city, there is huge demand but less supply(resource),
and In other City, there is huge supply but less demand.
Which City will you choose to launch Uber Pool ? Explain the Pros and Cons. 

-> What could be the Cons for the Uber Drivers ?

-> Suppose Uber Pool launch is failed. Who are the stakeholders, who will be affected the most ?

-> Explain any situation where you outperformed under tight deadline.

-> Explain any situation where you have conflict with your manager.
